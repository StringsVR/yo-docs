# Map IDs

## Format

### First Character

This will always be either an `e` or a `t`. If it is an `e`, it is a map used in an event or a cutscene. If it is a `t`, it is just a regular map.

### Second Character

This character is always a number. It is the zone that the map is in. The zone numbers change between games, so I will list them here.

*TBC*
