How to put New Models in YKW1 HD

Get the Model you want to put in, Whether it be a Port, or a Custom One made with Level5BlenderAddon

Step 2
Get an HD(Switch/Mobile) Model and extract a .xi and the .sil

Step 3
Save all the Textures of all the .xi in the new model as PNG

Step 4
Replace all .xi with the HD One, and the .Sil with the HD’s .sil

Step 5
Replace all the Replaced .xi’s textures with the Original backed up textures

Step 6
Save the .xc and put it over the character you want to replace

Step 7
Save your mod, and use the appropriate mod installation method for your platform(Foilo for Mobile, RomFS for Switch)
