# Playing/Testing Mods

## Citra

This is quite simple!

1. Ok, so you have your mod files in your `romfs` folder. Copy the folder.
2. Open Citra and right click the game you are using. Select "Open Mods Directory".
3. Paste your `romfs` folder here.
4. Launch your mod!


## 3DS

This one is a lot more annoying.

1. Make sure your 3DS console is modded. To do so, go to [this website](https://3ds.hacks.guide).
2. Insert your 3DS SD Card into your PC.
3. Go to `luma/titles`.
4. Go to [3dsdb](http://3dsdb.com) and search the title of your game to find its Title ID.
5. In `luma/titles` make a folder and name it the Title ID.
6. Copy your `romfs` folder and paste it in the folder you just made. You can now reinsert your SD card into the console.
7. Hold SELECT while booting your console.
8. Use the DPad to navigate down to `( ) Enable Game Patching` and press A. It should now be `(x) Enable Game Patching`.
9. Press START to save and reboot.
10. Launch your mod!
