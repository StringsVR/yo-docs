This glitch allows you to clone/duplicate Yo-kai.

## Guide

This requires two consoles.

- Create a BS/FS (YW2) or RCC/WDS (Blasters) file, play until you unlock trading
- Get whatever you want to clone onto it
- Import the file to PS (YW2) or MRC (Blasters), you can do this up to 3 times
- Once this is done, go back to the original file, trade everything there to another file and repeat the process
