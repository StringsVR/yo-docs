This glitch allows you to have more than 3 Yo-kai on the grid at the same time.

## Instructions

*Credit to lgknight/Agenericuser*

- Go to any Eyepo.

- Select any Yo-kai on your frontline, open the menu for setting Yo-kai over them.

- Select a Yo-kai and immediately scroll down, select yes. This replaces it with a blank medal.

- Repeat for the other 2.

- Enter a battle. Everything should now be stacked in the top left.

- Wait for them to all die. Then, your 3 backline ones come out in exchange for 1 dead one being on the backline.

- Use the medicine that revives everything and you'll now have 5 Yo-kai.

- To get 6, constantly replace the top left Yo-kai with your changing backline one.

- Use the medicine that revives everything again to get 6 out at once on the Tactics Board. This 6th Yo-kai cannot act.
