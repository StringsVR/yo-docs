This is a glitch that allows Nate to go to Springdale during Chapter 6. This can be done by choosing the female protagonist during the battle segment at Yopple HQ, and immediately giving up before any Yo-kai acts. You will be sent to Timers & More with the female protagonist still following the player, and can return by teleporting back to Yopple HQ from Timers & More. This cannot be repeated after this section is cleared.
