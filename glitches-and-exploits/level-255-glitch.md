# Level 255 Glitch

|Game|Yo-Kai Watch 3 1.0|
|Origin|Unknown|
|Clip/Guide|[shinobu789](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_KPGdCup2LI)|

This is a glitch in Yo-kai Watch 3 that allows for the drastic raising of any tradable Yo-kaiâ€™s stats by trading it back and forth between 2 versions of YKW3. Despite the name, your Yo-kai will not actually reach level 255. Note that leveling up or saving reverts these changes.
