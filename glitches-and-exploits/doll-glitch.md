This glitch allows you to flee any battle in the game, regardless of whether you're supposed to or not. It can result in softlocks, out of bounds glitches and other buggy states, but is sometimes useful.

## Guide
- Make sure you both have a Getaway Plush, and an inventory big enough to the point where you can scroll through it offscreen
- Put your Getaway Plush one row offscreen
- Select the item to the left of it, slowly drag whatever youâ€™re using to select it (e.g thumb, mouse etc) over to the Getaway Plush
- Right after the switch, hit A
